        Throughout my time as an undergraduate, I would create some study guides
        as part of reviewing course material. A number of people have found
        these to be helpful, so I figured it would be helpful to collect all of
        them into a single place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to thank these incredibly cool and attractive contributors
        who helped make these guides possible.

        <h2>CPSC 1070, Fall 2020</h2>
        <p>Programming Methodology, C++, Plaue</p>
        <p>
          This course served as my first introduction to programming in the
          context of a Computer Science degree, and served a very nice role in
          providing rigor to many of the concepts I learned when I first started
          programming. Clemson's introductory CS curriculum has a lot of overlap
          between courses, so some of the material here may also be applicable
          to CPSC 1010 or CPSC 1020
        </p>
        <p>Topics Covered:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>C++ Syntax and Semantics</li>

        <h2>CPSC 2310, Spring 2021</h2>
        <p>Introduction to Computer Organization, C, Feaster</p>
        <p>
          This course was probably my favorite online course I took at Clemson,
          and helped me fully understand a lot of concepts and foundations of
          computers I had only a basic knowledge of before.

        <ul>

        <h2>CPSC 2150, Spring 2021</h2>
        <p>Software Development Foundations, Java, Sun</p>
        <p>
          This course really helped me develop a sense of how to structure code
          well, and provided foundations for the academic underpinnings of the
          Software Engineering field.

        <h2>CPSC 2120, Fall 2021</h2>
        <p>Data Structures & Algorithms, C++, Dean</p>
        <p>
          Professor Dean's Algorithms course was probably the most
          intellectually challenging and rewarding undertakings I have ever
          undergone. The structure of Dean's algorithms course enabled me to
          solve problems much more effectively. The study guide here is a bit
          light, and not at all representative of course content, but included
          for completeness

        <h2>CPSC 3520, Spring 2022</h2>
        <p>Programming Systems, Ligon</p>
        <p>
          This course was an exploration of novel techniques which are often new
          to incoming programmers. The section about language grammars and the
          underpinnings of programming languages really tickled my PL brain.

        <h2>CPSC 3600, Spring 2022</h2>
        <p>Network Programming, C/Python, Cheng</p>
        <p>
          Networks are extremely important to most professional software
          developers. This course gave me a really good familiarity with
          networks and how to write code to interact with them. Some of the
          projects we wrote for this course have direct applicability to my
          future work.

        <p>Operating Systems, C, Sorber</p>
        <p>
          Sorber's Operating Systems course is known to be very challenging, but
          very rewarding. In addition to the structures of operating systems, I
          also learned a lot about why these systems are structured the way they
          are, and how people solved these fundamental problems in the past

        <p>Computer Architecture, C, Zhang</p>

          This course is a successor to CPSC 2310, and went into even more
          detail about the hardware of computer architecture.

        <p>
          Despite a difficult subject matter, Iuricich made this course quite
          accessible and structured things well. DSA II really helped to hone my
          algorithms skills from the first course, and I feel much more
          confident about applying these techniques in actual problems now.
